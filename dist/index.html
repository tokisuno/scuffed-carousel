    <h1>THIS IS PEAK</h1>
    <p>
    That's right, this absolute unit of an image carousel is a webapp made with webpack and goes through a directory of images. It takes an artistic approach, forcing all images to render in a stellar 640x360 for optimal viewing pleasure. It takes some years to reach such a monumental peak in their programming journeys, so I consider myself lucky to witness and be part of such an event.
